    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>I came up with this one night trying to "figure out" what dinner was going to be. Grabbed some things from the
        pantry and what turned out was a keeper.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground turkey</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups barbeque sauce (such as KC Masterpiece® Original)</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) bag frozen corn</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 (7.5 ounce) packages cornbread mix (such as Jiffy®)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>While pasta boils, heat oil in a 3-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook and stir
            until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground turkey and cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5
            to 7 minutes. Stir in barbeque sauce, corn, and red pepper flakes. Mix well, reduce heat, and let simmer for
            5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix cornbread mix, milk, and eggs together in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine macaroni, meat mixture, Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Pour mixture into the
            prepared dish. Spoon cornbread batter on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cornbread is light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and
            let cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
